# Find A Translation Key

If you are looking for a specific translation key in order to change the display text, you can easily find it by settings locale to `test` to make the cashier show every raw translation key.

From version 1.1.13 this will also print out raw translation string that in normal cases only will be visible if there's a translation added.
