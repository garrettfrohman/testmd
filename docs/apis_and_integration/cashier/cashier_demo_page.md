# Cashier Demo Page

You can try the cashier in a real "mocked" merchant environment at the demo page. You should be able to do most things as you can do on a merchants webpage but with a simplified flow

You can configure layout options and basic configs at "My account" after you have gone through the sign up step.
Whenever you make any changes to the cashier settings, the "Save config" button will be enabled at the bottom.
Click that button to update the cashier settings.

The demo page is 100% responsive.
