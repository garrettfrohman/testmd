# Configure Tracking

Due to a change in Google Chrome and Safari's cookie policy we no longer support user tracking with Google analytics or Hotjar and the feature is deprecated.

To get tracking setup we recommend using your own tracking account and sending events/updates based on the Cashier's event callbacks. [Read more about callback events here.](cashier_javascript_api)
