# Add Terms And Conditions 

Terms and condition templates uses the same approach as [Provider input templates](cashier_show_custom_provider_information) but are displayed under the submit button for all payment methods. 

This feature is meant to be used when the entire payment flow/site has terms&conditions that are applied across payment-methods. From cashier version 1.2.10 you can set this template to only apply to a few selected providers with the `enableTermsTemplateFor` config.

Reach out to technical support for help with this feature. You can also make a checkbox required before allowing the user to proceed with the payment.
