# Change A Provider Display Name

If you want to show another name for a provider, for example Creditcard -> Credit/Debit card you can add a translation in PaymentIQ Backoffice (PaymentIQ Backoffice -> Admin -> Messages).

The key should be the name of the provider capitalized, e.g:

```
Creditcard: 'Credit/Debit card',
Trustly: 'Direct bank payment'
```
