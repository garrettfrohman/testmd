# Standardized Cashier Introduction

The optional Standardized PaymentIQ cashier is a configurable front end cashier for your website, and removes the need for the Front API integration. Using the PIQ Cashier is the fastest way to ensure a quality integration of the DevCode PaymentIQ system into your own front end.

Choose from pre-set color styles with optional components, or choose a standard style with your own color selections. If your front end technical resources are limited, or your launch deadline is approaching, then using the Standardized Cashier is an option to consider.
