# Parameter Requirements

When you interact with the PaymentIQ APIs you will notice that the information you are required to include will vary. For example

- Providers may need additional parameters to function
- Credit card transactions and 3DS2 will require several extra parameters to go though without complications
- A payment facilitator setup require extra information in parameters.

It may seem like PaymentIQ is collecting as much information as possible but the opposite is true. We aim to make it as easy as possible to get the integrations up and running without complications and minimize the requirements on the merchants.

It is however important that when you implement our APIs you also follow the instructions and include the parameters we have listed and in the format they are requested. Troubleshooting integration/transaction issues from our end will always start with checking the communication flow and the parameters included as our experience have shown this is the source of most issues.

If you have questions about some specific parameter please let us know, but please note that the general answer will be the the specification or provider require it.
