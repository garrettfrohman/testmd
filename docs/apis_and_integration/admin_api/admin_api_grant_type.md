# Grant Type

There are two different ways you can get an access token to the Admin API.

## Client Credentials

This is the simplest of the OAuth 2.0 grants. This grant is suitable for machine-to-machine authentication where a specific user's permission to access data is not required.

## Authorization Code

The authorization code grant is specifically intended to be used for the 1-Click KYC API.
