This section outlines all the steps needed to make use of the PaymentIQ Admin API for backoffice features such as approving withdrawals and checking customer information. All steps and tests can be performed by the Merchant Teams as soon as they have access to the PaymentIQ backoffice.

**1)** The Merchant Onboarding Team familiarize themselves with the PaymentIQ Admin API documentation to understand what can be achieved via the API and what they will want to use the API for.

**2)** The Merchant Developer Team decides on which Grant Type to use.

**3)** The Merchant Operations Team (or The Merchant Developer Team if the have access) creates the Admin API Client in the PaymentIQ Backoffice following the relevant guides

**4)** When the Admin API Client has been configured the Merchant Developer should perform test requests for all feature you intend to use. Should any of them fail it will likely be due to incorrectly configured client / incorrectly chosen roles.
