# Documentation Overview

The PaymentIQ documentation portal is used my a lot of different people to accomplish tasks and projects. All the information available can therefore be somewhat overwhelming and it may be hard to know where to start. This document will explain how our documentation is organized and help you find the documentation relevant to your needs.

## Document Organization

The portal is divided into five sections.

- **Getting Started:** Contains a top level overview of what is required to integrate with PaymentIQ. Along with this documentation overview there are several documents to help plan an onboarding project. 
- **APIs & Integration:** Covers communication to and from PaymentIQ. This section is intended for the merchant development team tasked with doing the integration with PaymentIQ and connecting up the Merchant Operational Platform and Customer interfaces.
- **Setup & Configuration:** Gives instructions on how to do the required settings in PaymentIQ to have a system ready for operation as well as all the optional settings you as a merchant can make use of to optimize your use of PaymentIQ. This section is intended for the Merchant Operational Staff, but it also contains some basic tutorials which can be of use for anyone interacting with PaymentIQ. 
- **Troubleshooting & Support:** Contains instructions on how to handle common questions/issues and contact information to our Technical Support Team should it be needed. 
- **Release Notes:** Presents improvements and changes done to PaymentIQ as they are released. You can follow this section for new Payment Provider integrations and improvements.

## Document Structure

The current form of PaymentIQÂ´s documentation is built on a long history of documents all with the intent of helping our Merchant customers (you) accomplish your ambitions, but created with a changing scope/area of concern. 

Restructuring such a comprehensive information site and bringing the documents in line will be an ongoing project, and the current focus is to try and make it as clear as possible about the intent of a document.

To the greatest extent possible we want our documents to fall into one of four categories:

- **Overview:** Explains concepts and gives big-picture information about a specific topic.
- **Tutorial:** Gives step-by-step follow along instructions with the intent to teach you how to interact with PaymentIQ. It is important to note that the tutorials are exercise focused, not goal driven.
- **How-to:** Shows how to accomplish a specific task in PaymentIQ. In contrast to tutorials there is a specific end goal which should be clear to you before you start.
- **Reference:** Contains lists for you to look up specific information in regards to for example API-parameters, roles or email variable.


## Document Topics

If you are looking for some specific information but do not know where to look we recommend the search box in the top right corner. Hopefully by now knowing why we have organized the documents the way they are and the categories of documents we have you can combine this knowledge with the search result and find the document relevant to your queries.

Please reach out to us should you be unable to find whar you are looking for and we will try and either point you in the right direction, help answer your question and/or see if there is need to write new documentation.
