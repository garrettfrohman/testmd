### Notes

- Before start working with Piastrix service, merchants should have an active registered account [https://wallet.piastrix.com/auth/register](https://wallet.piastrix.com/auth/register) and active shop [https://wallet.piastrix.com/en/shops/create](https://wallet.piastrix.com/en/shops/create) , on behalf of which requests will be sent.
- Each shop has its own balance in each currency and it's not connected with the balance of personal wallet.
- Important! Success URL, Fail URL, Notification URL, Reject notification URL specified in the Shop settings have priority over the ones sent in the request, so for correct handling in PaymentIQ merchants need to remove them from the Shop settings.
