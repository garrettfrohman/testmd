## Provider Configuration

In order to enable TrustlyUS please follow these steps:

1. Run PaymentIQ and add the TrustlyUSConfig under Admin -> Configuration.
2. Add TrustlyUS to the `<psp>` section in MerchantConfig under Admin -> Configuration.
3. Enable WEBREDIRECT-TRUSTLYUS deposit and withdrawal method in Rules -> Payment methods.

### Transaction Flow

#### Deposits

1. The user enters the amount to be deposited in the cashier.
2. If it's a first time the user makes a deposit via TrustlyUS, the user gets redirected to the TrustlyUS lightbox where
   she / he is being asked to choose the bank account to be used for the deposit. If the user is using the account that already
   exists, step 4 is being directly executed.
3. TrustlyUS sends an authorization callback with an authorization transaction ID (it will be the parent transaction ID for
   every subsequent deposit made under this user account in the future) as well as 'splitToken' (used to identify users' accounts
   in TrustlyUS API) - these parameters are stored in the PaymentIQ database for further usage.
4. PaymentIQ sends a deposit request towards TrustlyUS with the following scenarios are possible: <br/>
   a) If TrustlyUS responds with a successful/declined status, PaymentIQ sets the transaction status to SUCCESS/FAILED. <br/>
   b) If TrustlyUS responds with a pending status, PaymentIQ awaits a callback from TrustlyUS, then performs a status check against the TrustlyUS API and updates the status of the transaction accordingly. <br/>
   c) If TrustlyUS responds with a status that indicates that the split token used for the transaction has expired, the process
   begins again from step 2 (redirection to TrustlyUS lightbox).<br/>

#### Withdrawal

1. The user enters the amount to be withdrawn in the cashier.
2. If it's a first time the user makes a withdrawal via TrustlyUS, the user gets redirected to the TrustlyUS lightbox where
   she / he is being asked to choose the bank account to be used for the deposit. If the user is using the account that already
   exists, step 4 is being directly executed.
3. TrustlyUS sends an authorization callback with an authorization transaction ID (it will be the parent transaction ID for
   every subsequent deposit made under this user account in the future) as well as 'splitToken' (used to identify users' accounts
   in TrustlyUS API) - these parameters are stored in the PaymentIQ database for further usage.
4. PaymentIQ sends a deposit request towards TrustlyUS. If TrustlyUS responds with a successful or pending status,
   PaymentIQ will set the transaction's status to SUCCESS_WAITING_CONFIRMATION and the transfer will be made to deduct the amount from the user's balance.
   Then, PaymentIQ awaits a callback from TrustlyUS regarding the status of the withdrawal. In case of a callback with
   a successful status, PaymentIQ will update the transaction's state to SUCCESS_WITHDRAWAL_APPROVAL. In case of a callback
   with a declined status, a reversal transaction will take place and the amount will be restored to the user's balance.
