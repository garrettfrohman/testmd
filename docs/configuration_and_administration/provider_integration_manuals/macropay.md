### Howtopay.com

The howtopay integration is now a separated psp called `Howtopay`. The documentation can be found [here](/docs/configuration_and_administration/provider_integration_manuals/howtopay) and the old `MacroPayWalletDeposit` api will be decommission in a near future.

### Important Information
- Currently MacroPay E-wallet doesn't send a callback notification for failed payments (it might be added in near future), and due to this, merchants need to set cancel job to suite their approach to MacroPay payments as payments will be in WAITING_NOTIFICATION state.
- Certain APM's such as Sofort has to be handled as a new window in the redirection, as opposed to the standard iframe container. Therefore it is necessary to create separate account configurations within the `MacroPayConfig` for these APM's. Setting the following tag inside the account will make sure it opens in a new window: `<container>window</container>`.

### Duplicated tx
When using the ```POLi service``` then a user can do a double deposit on the same PaymentIQ tx id.
MacroPay will send a notification with the new ```duplicated``` tx. This tx should be handled as a new tx. 
So PaymentIQ will create a new tx and will send authorize request in the integration-api with the new tx information (it will have the origin tx id as originTxId). 
The duplicated tx will have ```Received duplicate tx!``` in the info.
