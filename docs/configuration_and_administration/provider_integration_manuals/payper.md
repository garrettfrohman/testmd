### Obtaining public key and encryption key id

Obtaining public key and encryption key id should be the first step of enabling Payper as your payment service provider, 
as these fields have to be populated in your PayperConfig file in order for the integration to work properly.

In order to retrieve these credentials, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure you know your merchantId in PaymentIQ - you need to place it in your request where `{merchantId}` is located.
2. Make sure that you get your apiToken from Payper - it has to be placed in the header of the request where `{apiToken}` is located.
3. Send the following request to your respective environment:

For test environment (make sure that isTest=true):

```
curl --request GET \
     --url https://test-api.paymentiq.io/paymentiq/payper/rsa?isTest=true&merchantId={merchantId} \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {apiToken}'
```

For live environment (make sure that isTest=false):

```
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.paymentiq.io/paymentiq/payper/rsa?isTest=false&merchantId={merchantId} \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer {apiToken}'
```

4. In case of a successful request you will receive the following response:

```
{
  "errors": [],
  "key_id": 1000,
  "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCcwFaDLXSDn63b5RbLUk6M77pP\nDB8iGk0vxdnoujprEYzzeE5ehtItdmOQyogscf+AVAEL8LpKdgst7LLWR39rdfud\ngpOdj0t0LA5bFpufv8S1e8UrQF9XvZlSPa5wzFvo0SD7B1eLF4AHojFyM37ASg2t\nknPpCG8icxk+GjY3xQIDAQAB\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----",
  "status": true
}
```

A failed response would result in a 4XX or 5XX server response - in case that happens please contact PaymentIQ tech support.

5. Grab the "key_id" field value and populate it as the "encryptionKeysId" parameter in your PayperConfig.
6. Grab the "public_key" field value and populate it as the "pspPublicKey" parameter in your PayperConfig. Please make sure
that you replace every `\n` with a new line (enter). <br/>
A properly populated "pspPublicKey" parameter using the "public_key" from the example above should look exactly like this:

```
<pspPublicKey>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCcwFaDLXSDn63b5RbLUk6M77pP
DB8iGk0vxdnoujprEYzzeE5ehtItdmOQyogscf+AVAEL8LpKdgst7LLWR39rdfud
gpOdj0t0LA5bFpufv8S1e8UrQF9XvZlSPa5wzFvo0SD7B1eLF4AHojFyM37ASg2t
knPpCG8icxk+GjY3xQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----</pspPublicKey>
```
