# EMP CashLib

## About
Cashlib is a Payment Solution Provided by EMP-CORP in order to provide a solution that is designed to allow a clients to buy a voucher at a Distributor Point Of Sale (POS). Then the client can pay his purchases on affiliated e-merchant web sites with the vouchers he has previously bought.

CASHlib voucher is a paper ticket with a 16 digit Code associated with a Value and an Expiry_date (and other attributes).

After selecting Cashlib payment, the customer journey is the following:

1. User has to enter the 16 digit code on the e-merchant website to make his payment.
2. If the purchase amount is lower than voucher value then the voucher Balance is updated with the remaining value and the user may later make other payments with this voucher.
3. If the purchase amount is higher than user's voucher balance then the user may add other vouchers to reach the payment amount.

There are three types of transactions:
- Voucher Payment
- Voucher Direct Payment
- Voucher Payout

**Voucher Payment** permits to open an iframe on the userâ€™s web browser and entirely processes the payment with the connected customer. After completing the payment process, the customer is returned to the e-merchant URL (either success_url if payment is successful or cancel_url if the payment failed or has been cancelled by customer).

**Voucher Direct Payment** permits to make a payment with the voucher code via a direct server to server communication (no redirect to iframe).

**Voucher Payout** permits to issue a new voucher that can be used by customer to withdraw money.
