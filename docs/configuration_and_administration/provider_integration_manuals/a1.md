### Amount Codes
Deposits can only be made with pre defined amount voucher codes. These codes are provided by A1 and is entered in the `amountCodesMapping` config. The user must then select from these amounts only and should not be allowed to enter the amount freely.

### Provider Configuration
The callback URL must be sent to the A1 team and should be like this:

```${baseCallbackUrl}/api/a1/callback```

## Example Routing Rule
![](/img/providers/routing/a1.png)

## Transaction Flow
1. The user enters their phone number and selects an amount in the cashier.
2. A text message is sent to the user with a verification code.
3. The user is redirected to a page where they need to enter the verification code to proceed with the payment.
4. If the verification code is correct the payment request is sent to A1 and the payment is successful.

## Test Information
A1 doesn't have a test environment.
