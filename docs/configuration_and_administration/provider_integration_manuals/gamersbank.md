## Transaction Flow

### Creditcard operations
1. The end user fills in the transaction amount and card details.
2. PaymentIQ sends the deposit/withdrawal request to GamersBank.
3. GamersBank sends a response with the final status of the transaction.

### PIX operations
1. The end user fills in the transaction amount and national id(cpf).
2. PaymentIQ sends the deposit/withdrawal request to GamersBank.
3. GamersBank sends a response with initial status of transaction + redirect url.
4. User is redirected in order to complete the payment(for Pix Deposit just confirming/ for Pix Withdrawal the user also needs to fill in bank account details).
5. GamersBank sends a callback notification once the transaction status is updated on their side.
