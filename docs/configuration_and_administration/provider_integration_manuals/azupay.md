# Azupay

## About
Azupay allows your business to create PayIDs that your customers can use to pay for the services you provide.

**PayID** is the name of the New Payments Platform (NPP) addressing service.
Itâ€™s a function of the Platform that allows users to link easy-to-remember pieces of information, such as their phone number or email address, to their account.
Users can provide their PayID, instead of their BSB and account number, to people or organisations they wish to receive payments from in real-time.

## Example Routing Rule

![](/img/providers/routing/azupay.png)

## Transaction Flow

### Deposit:

1. Customer (a user of a merchant) requests PayID registration for further payment (top-up of his/her account within merchant's system).<br/>
2. PayID (in a form of email) is being generated either by PaymentIQ or by Azupay (depending on the settings above) and provided to the customer.<br/>
3. Customer proceeds with the payment in favor of the provided PayID in his/her banking app (possibly multiple times with any amounts).<br/>
4. Assets are being transferred to Azupay side.<br/>
5. Azupay notifies merchant on incoming deposit transaction.<br/>
6. Merchant tops-up the customer's account in the merchant's system.<br/>

### Withdrawal:

1. Customer (a user of a merchant) requests withdrawal of his/her account funds within merchant's system.<br/>
2. Customer chooses the type of his/her personal account (BSB; PayID: EMAIL or PHONE) for the funds to be transferred to.<br/>
3. Customer provides account details and amount to be withdrawn.<br/>
4. Customer submits the request for withdrawal.<br/>
5. Azupay processes the request and notifies merchant on any status change of the transaction.<br/>
6. Merchant updates the user account's balance according to the status notifications from Azupay.<br/>
7. Customer either gets his/her requested funds on his/her account or the withdrawal request is cancelled with respective reason.<br/>
