### Wait For Bank Withdrawal Notifications
The normal scenario is that PaymentIQ sets the withdrawal to success after it has been successfully received by Inovapay and waiting for it to be processed. If anything goes wrong during processing a reversal is created. To instead wait with setting success until a notification that the money has reached the user's account can be done by adding this to InovapayConfig:

`<waitForWithdrawalNotification>true</waitForWithdrawalNotification>`

Note that there is always a risk invovled with using this configuration that the merchant needs to be aware of. If anything goes wrong with the transaction (e.g. misconfiguration, human error, connection issues etc) while it is waiting to be processed at the provider that causes PaymentIQ to set it to FAILED means that a cancel will be sent to the merchant. At the same time it is possible that the provider successfully executed it and the user received the money on their end.

### Callback URL
Callback URL is set by INOVAPAY. it is needed for Bank transactions only.

## Transaction Flow

### Bank Deposit

After initiating the transaction with an `amount` of at least 50 BRL the user will be redirected to a bank selection page where the CPF value needs to be provided (CPF is the Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification, a number attributed by the Brazilian Federal Revenue. Each user (email address) can only have one CPF number).

After payment is confirmed the user will be redirected to the selected bank's page, e.g:

#### Pre-select bank method
By sending the `service` parameter with the BankDeposit request you can pre-select the bank choice in Inovapay's form, which will also disable the option to change bank once pre-selected. Please see the valid service parameter values below.

| Service value | Inovapay value  |
|---------------|-----------------|
| PIX           | pix             |
| BANCODOBRASIL | banco-do-brasil |
| BRADESCO      | bradesco        |
| CAIXA         | caixa           |
| ITAU          | itau            |
| SANTANDER     | santander       |

#### Pre-fill CPF
By sending the `nationalId` parameter with the BankDeposit request you can pre-fill the CPF value in Inovapay's form, which will also disable the option to change this value by the user.

### Bank Withdrawal

To initiate the transaction select an `amount` of at least 200 BRL. If using Pix as method only the parameter `nationalId (CPF)` is required, make sure that the CPF used is registered as a Pix key, for the other bank options `branchCode`, `accountNumber` and `accountType` are also required.

## Test Information
