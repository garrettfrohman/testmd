## Test Information
To test deposit/withdrawal select Cryptocurrency payment option in PaymentIQ Cashier, 
fill in any amount and follow the instruction after being redirected. Ask Coincorner support team for a wallet address
to test withdrawals.

One  will need to download a Testnet wallet and get some free testnet coins from a faucet. Recommended apps/sites to use for this can be seen below.
