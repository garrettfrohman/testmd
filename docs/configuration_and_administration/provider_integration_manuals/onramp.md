## Example Routing Rule

![](/img/providers/routing/onramp.png)

## Transaction Flow

### Deposits
1. User enters an amount in the cashier and clicks on "Deposit".
2. PaymentIQ sends a POST request to the PSP. An url is received in response, to which the user is redirected
   and where he fills in the info for completing transaction.
3. PaymentIQ receives a callback from the PSP and send back response with HTTP status 200.
Provider uses callback to confirm transaction. If response code is 200 - transaction confirmed, if response code is 204 - transaction canceled.
4. PaymentIQ pulls transaction status from OnRamp status endpoint and updates transaction accordingly.

### Withdrawals
1. User enters an amount in the cashier and clicks on "Withdraw".
2. The withdrawal is initiated and has to be approved in the backoffice if auto-approvals have not been set.
3. PaymentIQ sends a POST request to the PSP. An url is received in response which is stored by PaymentIQ.
4. Once the withdrawal has been approved, the user receives a link via the registered email address to the aforementioned
   url to complete the withdrawal in the OnRamp's dashboard. If user is not signed-in in OnRamp system, this url will take him to the sign-in page.
5. PaymentIQ receives a callback from the PSP and sends back response with HTTP status 200.
6. PaymentIQ pulls transaction status from OnRamp status endpoint and updates transaction accordingly.
