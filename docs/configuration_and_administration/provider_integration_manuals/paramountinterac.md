### Wait For Withdrawal Notifications
The normal scenario is that PaymentIQ sets the withdrawal to success after it has been successfully received by Paramount and waiting for it to be processed. If anything goes wrong during processing a reversal is created. To instead wait with setting success until a notification that the money has reached the user's account can be done by adding this to ParamountConfig:

`<waitForWithdrawalNotification>true</waitForWithdrawalNotification>`

Note that there is always a risk invovled with using this configuration that the merchant needs to be aware of. If anything goes wrong with the transaction (e.g. misconfiguration, human error, connection issues etc) while it is waiting to be processed at the provider that causes PaymentIQ to set it to FAILED means that a cancel will be sent to the merchant. At the same time it is possible that the provider successfully executed it and the user received the money on their end. So be very careful using this setting.


### Callback configuration 

You need to send PIQ callback URLS to Paramount.

Test callback Url : https://test-api.paymentiq.io/paymentiq/api/paramount/callback/

Live callback Url : https://api.paymentiq.io/paymentiq/api/paramount/callback/

### PayOut Testing steps

To initiate a Paramount Interac速 Payout test transaction, you need to enter the amount, select a security question and enter a security answer from the cahier.

You will need also to use a real email in the request, where you will be receiving an email from Paydirect billing Demo.

From that email, please go to the email headers and extract the value of the parameter `<X-PaymentKey>`
Then please send to Paramount the value of `<X-PaymentKey>` so that they can simulate the payout processing on their side, which will trigger the event notification being sent to PIQ.
