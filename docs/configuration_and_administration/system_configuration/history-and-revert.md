# Rule History and Revert

## Show Rule History
For each action (save, update, delete) a history entry for that rule will be saved. 
The 30 last entries can be viewed from each rule by clicking the “Show History” link.

For each rule history entry the version will be shown to the left and the message that was entered, who and when the action (save, update, delete) was made.

## Revert
By clicking the entry you can revert and view that version,
So for example: if we want to revert the “Change title (2)” then I click on “revert delete (1)” and the save it and write a good message for the action. Then this version will be the current version (3).
