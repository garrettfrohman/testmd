# Conditions And Actions

A detailed description of the different conditions and actions that can be used in the rule engine of the PaymentIQ back office.

A `Condition` is used in the rules to decide exactly for which conditions a transaction should match to trigger a specific rule. For example, the condition `User country` together with `Currency` could create a strong market based rule.

An `Action` is used in the same way but to decide what type of action to perform in the triggered rule, e.g in a routing rule to which `PSP` and `PSP account` to route with.

#### The different types

`Single select option` - Select from a drop-down where only one value can be chosen.

`Multiple select options` - Select from a drop-down where one or more values can be chosen.

`Regex free text` - Free text input field where regular expressions can be used.

`Free text` - Free text input field where regular expressions can not be used.

`Numeric text` - Numeric text input field where only a numeric value can be used, e.g 1

`Percentage` - Percentage input field where only percentage can be used, eg 1% or 0.30 (will be converted to 30%)

`Date picker` - Text input field supported by a date picker to select the right time format, e.g â€‹2018-01-01 00:00.

`Money list` - A list of amount and currency separated by comma (,), e.g 1000 EUR, 10000 SEK

**Notes:**
Regex free text refers to the query language Regex. A full explanation of Regex is beyond the scope of this guide, but there are great resources online to understand more regarding this query language, but the usage explained below may be helpful as these are frequently useful within PaymentIQ rules

| Regex Character | Meaning                 | Example Usage                |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| ```|```         | OR                      | ```455001 |465001 |475001``` |
| ```.```         | Wildcard                | ```455... |465... |475...``` |
| ```.*```        | Any number of wildcards | ```45.* |46.* |47.*```       |

#### The categories
The category column defines in what type of rule category the condition and action can be used in the back office, e.g `Routing` or `Fees`. For example, the `Threshold %` condition can only be used in the `Alert` rules. If a condition or action is noted as **All** then it can be used in all available rules except the noted exceptions.
