# Payment Method Logos

This section will initially display the enabled payment methods (based on the payment method rules) and their corresponding logo that will be used in the cashier for your specific MID. The main purpose of this section is for you to have the option to upload a logo of your own choice that you wish to be displayed for a specific payment method.
