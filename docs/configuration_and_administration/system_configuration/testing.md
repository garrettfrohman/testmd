# Testing

For most providers you will want to do test transactions in the staging environment to test how the dialogs look and that all the rules work as intended and that there are no unforeseen issues on your site.

PaymentIQ do not offer generic test cards/credentials to be used in these test transactions as most payment providers require specific ones to simulate different scenarios (ex. success/failure), transaction types (ex. 3DS v2) and so on. If you need test cards/voucher or some other form of test information please check on the specific provider page as we keep all our test data relevant to the provider there.

If we do not list any test data it means we are not able to offer it to that specific provider. You will then need to reach out directly to the provider for further information.
