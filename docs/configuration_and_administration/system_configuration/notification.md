# Notification Rules

PaymentIQ allows transaction events to trigger email templates to end users, and if required to specified email designated addresses.

The creation of actual email templates is covered later in the Admin section of the manual. Rules defining notifications will usually have multiple similar rules defined by language group, as the specified email templates will have to be composed in multiple languages appropriate to the merchants markets.

Rules are created in the same manner as with other categories, with conditions being defined, and actions taking place as a result. Conditions available are most of those associated with a transaction, and the player. The actions available include the possibility to send a copy of the email to an additional address, and the possibility to exclude the player from the email.

This has multiple possible uses.

## Confirmation of deposit or withdrawal

It is becoming increasingly usual for a confirmation of a successful transaction to be emailed to the player once it is complete.  Deposit confirmations can largely be seen as optional, but it has been noted that users do greatly appreciate a ‘confirmation of withdrawal approval’ email, and this also provides an additional marketing opportunity if wished.

## Initiation of an automated KYC request

It is possible to send a user who has a certain KYC status an automated email template requesting KYC documents. While this can be personalized to some extent, care must be taken with the composition of the email to ensure that it applies in all circumstances.

It is also possible to copy in the email address of the ticketing system and create a record of the KYC request within the merchant support environment.

This is most useful with the UK market, when an automated age check fails, and will ensure the maximum possible time available for the user to respond before mandatory account closure.

## Transaction amount alert emails

Notification emails can be set to trigger on parameters defined that relate to transaction amounts, although care should be taken to ensure that the same email is not sent to the end user.

The applications of this are legion.

**Example Fraud Alert:**

The Fraud department could receive alerts based on deposit attempts with possible fraud patterns.

**Example VIP withdrawal request:**

The payments team and fraud department could receive alerts based on large withdrawal requests that have been initiated.   VIP team is copied in.

**Example Large deposit alert:**

The VIP department could receive alerts for high depositors in order to initiate contact, with the fraud team copied in.

More applications of this can be envisaged by the merchant and the automation of the fraud and payments teams task focus based on real time alerts, should bring welcome improvements over the usual retrospective actions that are the norm across most of the industry.
