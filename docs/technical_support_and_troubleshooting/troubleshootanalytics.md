## Troubleshooting

### Does the Backoffice User Have The Right Roles?

Access to the Analytics Tab is controlled on a backoffice user level. An admin can enable access for a user by going to Admin > Backoffice Users and clicking on the specific user account.

There are two roles that give different types of access to Analytics: ROLE_ANALYTICS and ROLE_ANALYTICS admin. Adding either or both to the user and saving should make the Analytics Tab show for the user on their next login.

### Is Analytics Enabled for the MID?

If no roles are showing as options in the user section it means Analytics has not been enabled for the MID. This is done by the Onboarding or Tech Support teams at PaymentIQ.

### Contacting PaymentIQ Technical Support or Onboarding Support

If you need to have Analytics enabled for a MID or are having troubles with enabling it for a specific user, please reach out to the Onboarding Team if you are currently Onboarding or the Technical Support Team if you are live.

It is helpful for us when troubleshooting to know the MID and/or the Backoffice User you are having issues with and any other related information you have found in your troubleshooting.
