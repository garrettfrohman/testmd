|------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| 8547 | Task         | Trustly - Map Latvia accountNumber to PSP account         | Changed how we save the Latvian accountNumber with transactions via Trustly. Before we saved the masked IBAN e.g `***************654614` but now we save the full IBAN e.g `LV22HABA1234512654614`|
| 8594 | Task          | Handling possible exception when matching velocity rules in the right order + matching rules through BO   | Added handling for possible exceptions when matching velocity rules in the right order, and matching rules through BO with the new min amount action type|
| 8597 | Task          | Adyen checkout API - Send `countryCode`, `channel`, `shopperLocale` in request        | Added parameters `countryCode`, `channel`, and `shopperLocale` in request of the Adyen checkout API |
| 7996 | Feature       | Integrate new BIN data source                      | Added BINDB as a new data source for the BIN (a.k.a IIN) lookup table in order to have a more complete list, as well as better information about bank names, card types, brands etc.|
| 8474 | Feature | AstroPayCard withdrawals - Add option to send phone parameter as well as email parameter | By request from the provider we have added the option to send the phone number parameter in addition to email. This makes sure that the cashout will be sent to the mobile app which is the preferred option, and the only valid one in the future. To enable, add `<sendPhoneNumber>true</sendPhoneNumber>` to the AstroPayCardConfig|
| 8552 | Feature | GamMatrix - Add support for approving withdrawals from operator/merchant backoffice using polling job | Implemented a feature (right now solely for operators that use the GamMatrix (GM) platform) to poll the status from GM, and either do the approve or cancel on withdrawals in PIQ depending on what the status is on GM's end. |
| 8548 | Bug | Wirecard - Don't send the "RECURRING_TRANSACTION" request tag if it's not a recurring | Fixed an issue where we previously always sent the tag to Wirecard that indicates that it is a recurring payment. Now we only send it if the `useTokenId` account config tag is set to `true` which is the indicator that it's a recurring |
| 8565 | Bug | Zimpler - Check if the user PSP account with Zimpler token exists before doing direct withdrawal | Fixed an issue where it was possible to initiate a Zimpler direct withdrawal without a user PSP account which would result in a fail upon approval|
| 8617 | Bug | Hexopay - Only send language code, not full locale | Fixed an issue where we incorrectly sent the full locale instead of just the language code |
