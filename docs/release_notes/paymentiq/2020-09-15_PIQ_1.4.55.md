| 12675 | Feature | 3DS2 - support for referring acquirer BIN config from provider account config | Added support for referring acquirer BIN config from provider account config. |
| 12674 | Provider | Aircash Wallet - send username instead of userid in lookupUser request | The userid is now sent as username in the lookupUser request for Aircash Wallet. |
| 12671 | Provider | Payex - only send phoneNumber if 3DS2 | Fixed so that parameters `homePhoneNumber` and `workPhoneNumber` are only sent for 3DS2 payments with Payex. |
| 12665 | Improvement | 3DS2 - Credorax 3D server parameter cleanup | Made some cleanup on the requests PIQ does to the Credorax 3D server in order to align with their current API. |
| 12662 | Bug | Trustly - DenyWithdrawal not sent for Bank***Withdrawal TxTypes | Fixed an issue where the DenyWithdrawal request is not sent to Trustly for Bank***Withdrawal TxTypes. <br/><br/>Note that this doesn't affect TxType TrustlyWithdrawal or account payouts. |
| 12655 | Feature | Payex - override locale from verifyUser instead of locale parameter | To force PaymentIQ to use the verifyUser locale instead of the locale parameter sent in the front API, set the `<useLocaleFromVerifyUser>true</useLocaleFromVerifyUser>` in the account level of the provider configuration. <br/><br/> The locale parameter sent in the front API is also added to the /process input to get a better view what the cashier sends. |

| 12628 | Bug | 3DS2 - user account activation | Fix so that the 3DS2 transaction itself doesn't create an activated user account for a newly registered card.<br/><br/> Reverted this behaviour so the user account activation is only done by the outcome of the payment transaction (like in a normal non 3DS2 flow). |
