| 14295 | Feature | PSP last used condition - Add option to only consider transactions before the current tx | The `PSP last used` condition does not limit fetching the history of transactions to a specific date by default.<br/><br/> For withdrawal transactions, the approval can take some time before triggering the rules. Consequently, this condition will consider those transactions that were created after the targeted withdrawal transaction.<br/><br/>This update is to allow the merchant to limit the history to current transaction's created date. See the additional description below the table how to enable this. |
