| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 20166 | Bug | Name matching - Fix percentageMatch for name comparison | Corrected how the matching percentage is calculated for the "name matching" feature so that it correctly aligns with the Levenshtein distance. This may affect those who are using the name matching feature for certain payment methods if you have enabled it in the provider configuration by setting `matchAccountHolderName=true`.<br/><br/> The correction involves it being a bit more strict than it has been until now, and it means that you may see more transactions being declined because of stricter name matching, and you may want to adjust the match percentage threshold by setting a new value in the configuration entry `nameMatchPercentageThreshold`. The nameMatchPercentageThreshold entry is configured either in the MerchantConfig, or in the specific provider config directly, and it defaults to the value of 90 if it's not configured anywhere. |
| 20270 | Bug | Invalid 3ds version is used during SafeCharge ThreeDS2Authentication transaction   | Fixed a bug where the 3DS version was not set correctly during a SafeCharge ThreeDS2Authentication transaction. |
| 20224 | Task | Truelayer - Implement Name Check | The optional name matching feature has been added for Truelayer deposits. If the name matching for the account holder name fails, the transaction will be canceled. The name matching will be skipped for repeated payments. The feature can be enabled by adding `<matchAccountHolderName>true</matchAccountHolderName>` to the provider configuration. |
| 19903 | Task | SafeCharge - related TransactionID issue | Fixed relatedTransactionId issue for subscription payments with PSP SafeCharge. |
| 20204 | Task | Coindirect - set delay on status request after callback | Added a configurable delay for status check requests for PSP Coindirect. |
| 20293 | Task | PayRetailers - AccountAgencyNumber is only required for Brazil | Updated the PayRetailers integration by making `accountAgencyNumber` required only for Brazil. A new transaction type `PixWithdrawal` was also added which can be used to make PIX payouts for PayRetailers and other PSPs supporting PIX. The accountAgencyNumber parameter is now deprecated in the `PayRetailersWithdrawal` and will be removed in the future. Due to this, it is recommended to use `PixWithdrawal` for PIX payout in Brazil and `PayRetailersWithdrawal` for all other payout options. |
| 20235 | Task | Inpay - community payments > UI changes/improvements | Improved the UI/UX for Inpay Community Payments. |
| 20283 | Task | Interkassa - issues with getting ERR_INVALID_SIGNATURE | Solved an issue with signature validation for the PSP Interkassa that was caused by the URL decoding notification parameters before signature calculation. |
| 19713 | Task | BamboraGa 3DSv1 removal | Removed 3DS1 support for BamboraGa. |
| 20276 | Task | Safecharge 3DSv1 removal | Removed 3DS1 support for SafeCharge.|
