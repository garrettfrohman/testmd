| 12328 | Improvement  | Directa24 wait   for final state instead of setting successful directly | If   setting `<waitForWithdrawalNotification>true</>` in   Directa24Config, PayentIQ will set status `WAITING_NOTIFICATION` when the   withdrawal is created and update it when notifications are received. Be very   careful using this setting as there is always a risk in doing so, read more   in the provider manual. |
