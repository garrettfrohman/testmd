| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 14162 | Task | SaltarPay - 3DS v2 support | Added 3DS v2 support for SaltarPay (3DS v2 is handled by SaltarPay and we just send them browser related info). |
| 14100 | Task | LPS/Latpay - Handle inconsistent/contridctory statuses from provider | Fixes problem introduced by 13262 in version 1.4.69 that saw failed transactions set as successful in PaymentIQ for certain combination of statuses from Latpay. |
| 14090 | Bug | Support for cardholderRef in BamboraGA for non PF setups | Constraints for cardholderRef:<br/>- Only characters between x20 to x7F in the 7-bit ASCII characters table [https://donsnotes.com/tech/charsets/ascii.html](https://donsnotes.com/tech/charsets/ascii.html). Having characters outside the range will result in a failed transaction<br/>- Max length is 25 characters. If file is longer than that the string will be truncated. The reference appearing in the cardholder's bank statement is the resulting string from concatenating the merchant name and cardholderRef in this format: `<merchant name>*<cardholderref>`<br/>- The maximum length of this reference for Visa transactions is 25 characters.<br/>- In case of Mastercard transactions the maximum length is 22 characters. BamboraGa will truncate the cardholderRef if necessary to be able to meet Visa or Mastercard requirements<br/>- Merchant name is the name of the merchant stored in Elixir (known as merchant DBA name) |
| 14060 | Provider | Kluwp -> CardPay fallback, card_account not sent | Fixed an issue where Kluwp's callback was processed after a fallback to another provider was made. |
| 13977 | Provider | MobilePay - Allow Logo and merchant name to be sent dynamically | Added the possibility to send the logo URL and merchant name per transaction. This is done by sending attributes in the merchant authorize response to PIQ. The attribute names should be `subMerchantLogoUrl` and `subMerchantName`. If these attributes are not sent the values will be taken from the MobilePayConfig as usual. |
| 13982 | Provider | PowerPay21 - status check shortcomings | Fixes an issue where Powerpay sometimes returns a "not found" error on the status check even if the transaction is successful. Previously, PaymentIQ would fail the transaction when that happened, now it will keep it in state WAITING_INPUT. |
| 13898 | Provider | PowerPay21 - Add support for CFT withdrawals for gambling | Added support for gambling CFT withdrawals, where a reference to a previous deposit is used. |
| 13834 | Provider | PowerPay21 - Some PSP status messages missing | PowerPay21 has several parameters where their status message can be included. In this update, we made sure that PIQ tries to retrieve the message from their `error_messages` value if the value in `errormessage` parameter is empty in order to populate it to the info column in PIQ.<br/><br/>There will still be some rare cases when PowerPay21 don't return a status message at all, which means that PIQ won't be able to populate anything to the info column. |
| 13639 | Task | eCommpay - Dynamically display the banks in the cashier  | Added a feature to fetch banks from eCommPay dynamically to display in the cashier. The credentials to use when fetching the banks must be added in an account named `default` in the ECommPayConfig. |
| 13589 | Provider | PPro - Add support for APM BLIK and Paybybankapp | Added support for APMs Blik and Pay by Bank App (PbBa) via PPro.<br/><br/>When using PbBa it's possible to set an "app to app URL" if the merchant wants to redirect the consumer back to the app which invoked the payment. Added by setting `<appToAppURL>wanted URL</appToAppURL>` in the root level of the PProConfig. |
| 13243 | Provider | Zimpler -payouts Germany, Netherlands, Latvia | Zimpler now fully supports BankIBANWithdrawal |
| 13717 | New Provider | TransactEU integration | Integrated TransactEU - a credit card provider offering 3DS Deposit, Auth, full Capture/Refund, Void. 3DS2 is also supported. |
