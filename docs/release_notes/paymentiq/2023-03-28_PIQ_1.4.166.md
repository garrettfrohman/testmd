| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 20321 | Bug | Default HTML template is not working as locale fallback template | Fixed a bug where a locale-specific HTML template was used instead of using the default one without a locale. |
| 20171 | Bug | BinBlockRes should be added in TX_CMDS even when we do not find any matching IIN. | Fixed an issue where the BinBlockRes was not added to the TxCmd list if issuer info was not found for the BIN. A BinBlockRes will now be added with the `binType` and `cardBrand` set to `UNKNOWN`. |
| 19687 | Feature | PaymentCenter/Impaya fallbacks issue | Added fallback support on the 3DS flow for PSPs PaymentCenter and Impaya. |
| 20334 | Task |  Seon - user_created and merchant_created_at parameters are sent with the wrong format | Adjusted the user creation date from 13 digits (milliseconds) to 10 digits (seconds) for Fraud provider Seon so that they can parse it correctly. |

| 20183 | Task | Mifinity - API update for PAB and fix in status cmd | Fixed withdrawal (payout) handling for card, bank, and wallet-related operations. <br/><br/>Wallet withdrawal operation is synchronous which means that PaymentIQ will receive the transaction status in the response. All other operations are asynchronous which means that PaymentIQ will wait on the callback notification from the provider in order to trigger the status check API and update the transaction status accordingly.<br/><br/> In case of withdrawal failure, PaymentIQ will not fail the initial transaction and will create a new reversal transaction (with txType=Reversal) that will need to be handled by the merchant. |
| 19983 | Task | Truelayer - Maintenance update | Maintenance update for TrueLayer integration with support for new top-up logic for EUR payments, sending of additional user information and beneficiary reference field within payment requests, and additional deposit option with bank account verification. |
