| 19299 | Feature | Add new "errors keys" in PIQ based on Payment Method and not only Txtype | Added a new set of error keys to the front API/Cashier response of PaymentIQ that one can use to set specific translation messages. The key's first value is based on the payment method (`deposit` or `withdrawal`), the second part is `pspcode`, and the last part is the actual code from the PSP or a customized code from status code rules.<br/>Examples:<br/>`deposit.pspcode.400`<br/>`withdrawal.pspcode.5`<br/>`deposit.pspcode.custom_code` | 
| 19556 | Bug | Zimpler - recurring withdrawal flow issues | Fixed a bug where double auto approvals could happen with Zimpler recurring withdrawals. | 
| 19520 | Bug | SBTech - Default session cache timeout of 10 minutes is too short | Raised the default cache timeout for SBTech sessions. | 
| 19577 | Provider | Citizen - Payment Giro currency mapping | Set the value of PaymentGiro field based on Currency (FPS for GBP & SEPA for EUR). | 
| 19359 | Bug | Payoro - not handling callback correctly | Fixed withdrawal handling for the "cancelled" notification status from Payoro. | 
| 19438 | Task | EasyPay - PIQ returning incorrect response | PaymentIQ now also returns the status on already processed transactions for EasypayBatchDeposit ("/process" endpoint) | 
| 19528 | Bug | AstroPay - CardWithdrawal transaction supposedly using the status check endpoint incorrectly | Parse the `cashout_id` from the withdrawal notification of Astropay and set it as `pspRefId` on the transaction in case it's blank. | 
| 19549 | Task | Vipps - capture inconsistent if HTTP error | The HTTP response code 503 is now properly handled for Vipps. The transaction status in this case will be set to ERR_INCONSISTENT_TRANSACTION. |
