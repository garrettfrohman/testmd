| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 15701 | Task | SumoPay add exchange amount feature | Added an exchange transaction amount feature to provide merchants the ability to operate a currency that differs from the providers currency. |
| 15698 | Bug | Swish - Fix issue when withdrawal confirmation callback comes "too fast" | Fixed an issue when Swish sends the confirmation callback "too fast", causing withdrawals too stay in status code SUCCESS_WAITING_CONFIRMATION and not update to the final status code SUCCESS_WITHDRAWAL_APPROVAL / SUCCESS_WITHDRAWAL_AUTO_APPROVAL. |
| 15683 | Task | Biilz - fix access token caching issue | Fixed an access token caching issue with Biilz. |

| 15668 | Bug | Brite - Fix creating duplicate BankIban user psp account | Fixed so that a new account is not created if the IBAN from the user input was used to make the transaction with Brite. Instead use the account that was sent/created from the input. |
| 15540 | Bug | SbTech - PIQ responds with CANCELLED on status request but tx later gets successful | Fixed an issue when the status request is made while PaymentIQ is still waiting for response from the PSP that caused PaymentIQ to respond with status CANCELLED. |
| 15302 | Bug | Trustly - Check user psp account fraud rules after callback | Fixed so that the user PSP account fraud rules can be matched after we get the callback with account data from the provider. If any fraud checks matches the state of the transaction will be set to INCONSISTENT since it most likely already have been processed by the provider. Two new status codes will be used depending on what type of fraud check was matched:<br/>Too many user PSP accounts = `ERR_INCONSISTENT_TOO_MANY_PSP_ACCOUNTS`<br/>PSP account used by other user = `ERR_INCONSISTENT_PSP_ACCOUNT_USED_BY_OTHER_USER`<br/>Any other fraud check match = `ERR_INCONSISTENT_TRANSACTION`<br/>Note that this feature will depend on the account notification from Trustly. Only when the account notification is received are the user psp account fraud rules matched. This is why we also added a feature to set the transaction to INCONSISTENT if the account notification is missing. It is enabled by setting this on root level in TrustlyConfig:`<setToInconsistentIfMissingAccountNotification>true</setToInconsistentIfMissingAccountNotification>` |
