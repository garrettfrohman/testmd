| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 14613 | Bug | MiFinity - Fix issue where invalid JSON is sent to the provider | Fixed an issue where the withdrawal flow proceeded even if MiFinity's response to the bank fields request was empty. This caused PaymentIQ to send invalid JSON in the actual withdrawal request. <br/><br/>The transaction will now fail in PaymentIQ if empty bank fields response is received |
| 14609 | Bug | MiFinity - Transactions stuck in PROCESSING but should be in WAITING_NOTIFICATION | Fixed a bug with status mapping that caused the transaction state to be set to PROCESSING. |
| 14581 | Bug | MobilePay - Captures / refunds errors | Fixed an issue that caused captures and refunds for MobilePay transactions that were created before the 1.4.75 release to fail. |
| 14577 | Feature | "BinType" in "/paymentiq/admin/v1/payments" output | Admin API search results now include the field `issuerInfoType`(BIN type) for credit card transactions when reading from Elasticsearch.  |
| 14575 | Feature | Epay - Make possible to configure if auths should send the "create subscription" flag | Added a setting that controls if the "create subscription" flag should be sent to EPay. It can be used both on top and account level in the EPayConfig. The default is the current behavior, i.e. the flag is sent.<br/><br/> To not send it, the following config entry has to be added: `<createSubscription>false</createSubscription>` |
| 14567 | Provider | Yapeal - Redirect to waiting page feature | Implemented a "waiting page" for deposits which the user is redirected to while confirming the payment in the app. The waiting page will poll PaymentIQ for the final transaction status and then redirect to the success/failure URL. |
| 14551 | Task | Paymero - integration updates | Integrated NetBanking, UPI, and Wallet bank payments as separate options. Added user validation for INR currency.  |
| 14494 | Bug | Do not create new UserAccount for each EasyPayBatchDeposit | Fixed an issue where duplicate accounts were created for EasyPayBatchDeposit |
| 14467 | Bug | MobilePay - Tx stuck in processing when update payment request throws exception | Fixed so that failed requests to MobilePay after the transaction is done doesn't affect the transaction status. |
| 14465 | Provider | Netbanking - Send "defaultDescriptor" via "c2" parameter for deposits | Made sure that PIQ sends the "c2" (Custom 2) parameter to Netbanking for deposits. The parameter value is populated from the "defaultDescriptor" config entry.<br/><br/>The merchant can for example send their merchant txId by setting `<defaultDescriptor>${ptx.merchantTxId}</defaultDescriptor>`. |
| 14459 | Task | Envoy Giropay service - Verify Name Match | Added a new element `<verifyNameMatchServicePattern></verifyNameMatchServicePattern>` to the `EnvoyConfig`. If the `service` parameter is a match against the regex defined there, the general name matching feature is performed after a deposit. |
| 14351 | Provider | Safecharge - add new APMs | Added support for new Safecharge APMs: Elementpay (EPS), Multibanco, SEPA. |
| 14285 | Provider | Macropay - Send source URL and IP address | Added the possibility to send the parameters `source_url` and `source_ip` to MacroPay. <br/><br/>The values are set by configuring the following parameters in the MacroPayConfig (works on both top and account level):`<merchantUrl>https://example.com</merchantUrl>` `<merchantIp>127.0.0.1</merchantIp>` |
| 14228 | Task | HexoPay - Sending default gender | Made sure that PIQ sends a default gender to HexoPay if `sex` is not defined on the merchant user.  |
| 14067 | Task | BestPay - Disable parsing of bank data from clearing number | Added the feature flag `<skipClearingNumberValidation>true</skipClearingNumberValidation>` to skip clearingNumber validation for BestPay payouts. |
| 14031 | Bug | Funanga - redirect canceled transactions to cancel url instead of fail url  | Fixed so that transactions are cancelled correctly when redirecting to the cancel URL. |
| 14014 | Bug | EcoPayz - Handle cancel URL | Made sure that PIQ uses the cancel redirect URL if an Ecopayz transaction was canceled by the user. |
| 13902 | Bug | Export KYC data via advanced search does not work | CSV exports from the `Advanced search` window in the KYC section are now correctly populated. |
| 13825 | Task | Elastic Search - add support for origin-tx | Fixed a problem where related transactions weren't included in filtered search when using elastic search. |
