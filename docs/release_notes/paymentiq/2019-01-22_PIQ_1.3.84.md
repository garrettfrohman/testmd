| 7972 | Improvement  | Trustly direct debit is enabled in a second call                              | PaymentIQ is using Trustly direct debit ```https://trustly.com/en/developer/api#/directdebit``` to check if we get accountId from the account notification. <br/><br/>This is not fully implemented however as we get the accountId although the direct debit mandate is not validated. This information comes in a second account notification call where Trustly will send directDebitMandate 1 or 0. <br/><br/>With this tickt we added support to check directDebitMandate in the second accound notification call from Trustly. Since if directDebitMandate is 0 PaymentIQ should not do a direct debit although accountId is set. Note that this will also require the merchant to send in accountId to ```api/trustly/deposit/process.``` |
