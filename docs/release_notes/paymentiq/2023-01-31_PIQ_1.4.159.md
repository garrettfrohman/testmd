It can be used by merchants to identify if a transaction was initiated by the provider, and not from the PaymentIQ cashier/Front API.<br/><br/> To receive this information in the merchant authorize request, it has to be configured in the MerchantConfig using `<extraAttributes>` as the example below. <br/>```<extraAttributes><entry><string>initiatedByPsp</string><string>${ptx.initiatedByPsp}</string></entry></extraAttributes>```<br/><br/>It is recommended to have the technical support assist with such configurations, and first try it out in the test environment. |
