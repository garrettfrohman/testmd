| 15312 | Provider | Credorax - re-map code RC_54 | Re-mapped Credorax code RC_54 from ERR_DECLINED_EXPIRED to ERR_DECLINED_CARD_EXPIRED. |

| 15285 | Provider | CryptoPay - Fix status code mapping for on hold deposits | Set status code to WAITING_DEPOSIT_ON_HOLD_APPROVAL on deposits when CryptoPay responds with status "on_hold". |
| 15255 | Provider | Trustly - Name verification using account notification | A new feature that makes it possible to do the name verification based on Trustly's account notification instead of KYC notification (which the already implemented name verification uses). The transaction will be set to status code ERR_NAME_MISMATCH and state INCONSISTENT if the names don't match.<br/><br/>The feature is activated by adding the following in TrustlyConfig, either on top or account level: `<matchAccountHolderNameFromAccountNotification>true</matchAccountHolderNameFromAccountNotification>`<br/><br/>Also remember that PaymentIQ must have received the account notification for the verification to be possible, so it will be useful to use this feature together with `<accountNotificationWaitTimeSeconds>`, which sets how long PaymentIQ will wait for the account notification. If no account notification was received within that time the transaction will be put to state INCONSISTENT. |
| 14701 | Provider | Trustly - NameVerify | Added support for Trustly's "NameVerify" feature where the first and last name of the user is received in a KYC notification which allows the name matching feature in PIQ to be used.<br/><br/>Enabled in PIQ by adding `<nameVerify>true</nameVerify>` on the account level in the TrustlyConfig (it also needs a dedicated account on Trustly's side). |
| 15231 | Task | TrueLayer - enable creating user PSP account when tx is settled | Solved an issue where some transactions don't have a user PSP account by creating an account when we get a notification that the tx is settled. |
| 15051 | Feature | PSP accounts as a drop down list | Show available PSP accounts in a dropdown select list instead of a free text field of the "PSP account" action in the rules section. The accounts to choose from are fetched from the provider config. |
| 15033 | Bug | Brite - handle update of failed transaction to settled | Implement reversals for failed deposits. This means that if Brite sends a success callback for a deposit that is already failed, PIQ will create a new "Reversal" transaction which will send a transfer notification with the same amount as the original deposit. |
| 14965 | Feature | Auto On Hold from approval rules | Added a feature to set a withdrawal transaction to "On hold" from approval rules by using the Approval action "Hold". |
| 14358 | Bug | Sticpay - occasionally matches and updates wrong user PSP account | Fixed a bug where PIQ would incorrectly update an already existing saved user PSP account for another wallet provider if the end-user's email used for Sticpay is the same email used for the other PSP. |
| 14119 | Provider | Safecharge - cashier solution | There is now a `useCashier` flag for SafeChargeRestConfig which can be set to true to use SafeCharge's Cashier(redirect) solution. It defaults to false. |
