|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 15651 | Task | JPay fixing ptx not created when having more than one accountconfig | Fixed an issue where an exception was thrown when trying to retrieve the PSP account in PIQ, which was causing the payment transaction not to be created. |
| 15638 | Bug | MobilePay - Tokens (v3) not working when using setting selectProviderAfterCallback | Made a fix so that v3 and `<selectProviderAfterCallback>` can be used simultaneously. |
| 15615 | Bug | Admin API - Allow searching for merchantTxId | Added merchantTxId as query parameter to the search method in the Admin API. |
| 15609 | Feature | Trustly - Send the ShopperStatement for all Trustly based methods | Made sure that PIQ sends the "ShopperStatement" for all method types with Trustly. The ShopperStatement is based on the "defaultDescriptor" value set in the TrustlyConfig. |
| 15603 | Task | Adyen - Add getter methods to AdyenCallbackInput | Added getter methods in AdyenCallbackInput to make it possible to add the values from this input as extraAttributes in MerchantConfig. |
| 15317 | Provider | Directa24 - Send flag "mobile" | Made sure PIQ sends the `mobile` parameter (true/false) to Directa24, which should help increase the conversion rate for mobile devices. |
| 14657 | Bug | Account limit rules not working when the psp account details are sent by the psp via the transaction callback  | Fixed so that user PSP account fraud rules can be matched after we get the callback with account data from the provider. If any fraud checks matches the state of the transaction will be set to INCONSISTENT since it most likely already have been processed by the provider. <br/><br/>Two new status codes will be used depending on what type of fraud check was matched:<br/>Too many user PSP accounts = `ERR_INCONSISTENT_TOO_MANY_PSP_ACCOUNTS`<br/>PSP account used by other user = `ERR_INCONSISTENT_PSP_ACCOUNT_USED_BY_OTHER_USER`<br/>Any other fraud check match = `ERR_INCONSISTENT_TRANSACTION`<br/><br/>Note that this feature has to be implemented for each PSP / TxType in PIQ. In this fix it has been done for EcoPayz and AstroPayCard using the OneTouch API. |
