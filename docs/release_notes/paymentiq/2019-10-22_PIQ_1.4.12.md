| 9873 | Bug          | Shall not activate a blocked user psp account when   receiving callback or pulling status | Resolved an issue where when an   agent blocks a user psp account with a ongoing transaction in 'Waiting_Input'   status, it could be unblocked on notification or status poll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 9867 | Feature      | Apco Elegro - Allow a different amount in callback                                        | Changed to allow a different amount   in callback for Apco Elegro transactions. This change was done as it is   possible with the Elegro APM via Apco that the amount can be changed on the   Elegro side (user can choose to send a higher or lower amount), and therefore   in the callback from Apco the amount has changed. With this change those   types transactions will not fail.         |
