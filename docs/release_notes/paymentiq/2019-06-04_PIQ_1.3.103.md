| 8993 | Bug          | RoyalPay - Fraud check on withdrawals incorrectly fails transactions | PaymentIQ does a "fraud" check on the amount once in the response back from RoyalPay. A recent fix for   RoyalPay withdrawals was made to send the amount as positive instead of negative, however in the PaymentIQ fraud check this was not taken into account and so the transactions were rejected as potential fraud. This fix resolves that issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |  |
| 8913 | Feature      | Export User Preferred columns.                                         | A new feature where by adding   <br/><br/>   `<exportUserPreferenceColumns>true</exportUserPreferenceColumns>`  <br/><br/> to the MerchantConfig file will make the data exports only use the backoffice users preferred columns. Otherwise, a full of all existing columns will be exported as usual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |  |
| 8907 | Feature      | Possibility to add service field to user PSP account                   | This feature is the first step in a direction to be able to connect a service used with a transaction to the one  saved on the user account, e.g an `ApcoDeposit` with service `SKRILL`. This first step includes a new column in the **User accounts** view called **Service** where the name of the service will be displayed, and "service" will also be present in the front API JSON response on the account level (given that there is a service saved for the account). This allows a merchant to be able to better display the saved accounts in their cashier/checkout. <br/><br/>In this release, saving service on accounts is only enabled for provider Apco, transaction type ApcoDeposit, but it will be added for further PSPs and transaction types in the future. |  |
