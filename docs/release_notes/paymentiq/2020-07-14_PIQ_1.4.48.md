| 12084 | Provider    | WorldPay - decline withdrawal if fast funds is not   supported    | When attempting Fast Funds via   WorldPay (Visa Direct) we now decline the withdrawal instead of attempting a   regular withdrawal when the card does not support fast funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11993 | Provider    | Interac - do not consider INITED as successful for   withdrawals  | Added an option to set Interac   withdrawals to a pending state in PIQ in order to wait for the final state   from a callback notification, instead of putting them directly to   success.<br/><br/>Enable by adding the following entry to the   InteracConfig:<br/>   `<waitForWithdrawalNotification>true</waitForWithdrawalNotification>`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11514 | Feature     | Adyen - force specific country code value  - ignore user location | Feature to force sending a specific   country code value for the targeted account config in AdyenConfig. For   example, if the merchant would like to force a the Swedish country code value   for Netherland, the following tag should be added to the targeted account   config. <br/>If this is to be used for a specific method such as Sofort   only where the other methods (such as EPS and Ideal) shall continue using   users' country code, then you need to add a new account config for Sofort and   add the the following tag in it. Then, make sure that you have proper routing   rules in place. <br/><br/>   `<forceCountryCode>NL->SE</forceCountryCode>` |
| 12135 | Provider    | EMerchantPay - Add "reconcile" method to check transaction status | Added the "reconcile" API method to check the transaction statuses against EMerchantPay. This will for example improve the information in PaymentIQ for declined transactions. |
