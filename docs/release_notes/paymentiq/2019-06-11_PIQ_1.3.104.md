| 9019 | Bug          | WorldPay - Not sending store credentials for recurring payments | Previous updates were done to the WorldPay integration in April, where we added flags for stored credentials usage in the request. However, it was missed to be added in a particular request "PayAsOrder" which is used when it is a repeat payment and the PSP account has `useTokenId - true`. This has now been added as well.                                                    |
