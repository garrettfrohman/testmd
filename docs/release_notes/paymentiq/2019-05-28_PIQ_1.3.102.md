| 8905 | Feature      | MobilePay - ShopId                              | Set ShopID to always match the   MerchantID.                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 8954 | Improvement  | Ilixium: Not handling cancel notification correctly                         | Some Ilixium cancellations were   incorrectly marked as failed /fraud. With this fix they now correctly end up   in cancelled state.                                                                                                        |
| 8945 | Bug          | Adyen - Do status check only if PaymentIQ don't have a   callback input            | Changed so that a status check only   is done when PaymentIq does not have a callback input. This is done since the   status check has less information and so it is preferable to create the   statusTxRes from the callback.             |
