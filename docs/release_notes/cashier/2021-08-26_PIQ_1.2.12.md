| 15843 | Task | UI feedback when PM req fails in autoprocess=true | If you have configured the cashier to autoProcess but at the same time have set invalid credentials for mId, userId or sessionid the cashier would show as blank. This fix make the cashier show the error screen. | 
| 15740 | Task | showReceipt: only supports succesful transactions. If you use a txRefId for a failed tx, it should route to status page | The cashier can be displayed to only show the receipt, provided that you have included the txRefId you want to show a receipt for. This fix allows you to show a receipt for transactions that have other statuses than Successful. | 
| 15690 | Task | Input template: submit validation on required fields | InputTemplates can contain input fields that should pass on data in the validate+process requests to PIQ. If these exists and the cashier has been configured to autoProcess, the autoProcess should be cancelled if required fields exists and have not been filled out. | 
| 15539 | Task | ProviderRedirectIframe - height fix | RedirectIframe is a component we use to display the provider when the redirectOutput we receive from PaymentIQ requires a formPost to be done. The result of the post is then displayed in the iframe. This component did not read the configured height set in the providerConfig. |
