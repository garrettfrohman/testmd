| 14927 | Task | Allow configuring providers to ignore window close as cancel | Certain providers require the user to close the window after the transaction flow is complete, or some results in a transaction where the status is not complete. If the user then closes the window the cashier's default behaviour is to display a Cancelled-screen. You can now pass in a list of providers that should not treat closing the window as a cancel and instead poll the tx-status and show it as pending. |
| 14862 | Task | Add e2e for transactionLink | Testcase for transaction history items that require user action (complete a transaction for example). |
| 14858 | Task | Support a user with currency Bitcoin and display amounts with 8 decimals | Support for custom currencies outside the scope of the official W3C docs of supported currencies. This to support Bitcoin or MBitcoin. |
| 14787 | Task | Optimization: Call getTransactionHistory after initial load | GetTransactionHistory was a part of the getInitialData method. Until this method was resolved, we were showing the loader and not calling cashierInitLoad callback. This fix calls getTransactionHistory after the initialLoad. |
| 14775 | Task | Fix back behaviour across footer and header + E2E | New config property added: showBackAtInitPath.<br/><br/> If preset to show a provider, this config hides the back button when viewing the initial path. |
| 14734 | Task | Optional alternate loader: Animated content loader | New loader - content loader that mimics the list view (facebook/linkedin influenced). |
