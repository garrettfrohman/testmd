| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 14485 | Task | Bug: Trigger a second transaction when clicking submit repeatedly | Bugfix: There was a very brief window where submit button toggled from disabled + loading to enabled, just before the transaction was either done or the provider was supposed to be shown. Added a small delay to this + submit shows as loading when polling tx status. |
| 14450 | Task | Hosted fields: Iframe html has a css-rule that sets the background to white !important | Hosted-fields now on 1.0.30 - where the background color of the iframe is no longer set to white !important, but transparent. |
| 14439 | Task | BUG: Cancelling new provider window changes payment method | When initiating a transaction with a provider configured to be opened in a new tab - clicking cancel in the cashier would reset the selected payment method to the first one - but not actually cancel anything. No clicking cancel will close the provider window and navigate back to the list view. |
| 14413 | Task | Account names need break-word - causes icons to shrink | Layout fix where account names are very long - and the text overflows the available space. Break the account name with ellipsis, put the whole account in a tooltip + show the whole account name with word-break when the account is open. |
| 14382 | Task | Add support for order freightFee | Freight-fee can now be included and will be displayed on the receipt in the order details. |
| 14356 | Task | Implement callback for transactionInit | New callback: transactionInit. Triggered when the user clicks the submit button and the initial validation passes. Requires piq-bootstrapper 1.3.7 |
| 14350 | Task | Configurable: Preset amount to user's last deposit's amount | Allow the amount to be automatically set to the user's last successful deposit. Allowing for a repeat payment. Use lastUsedDepositAmount: true |
| 14342 | Task | Bug: Clicking back from Transaction history shows a blank screen with loader | When clicking "Back" in the footer while on the transaction history tab - no data was showing, just an endless spinner. |
| 14338 | Task | E2e hakkespro github links -> replace with local files | Testcases used to target a html file deployed on a personal github account. Uploaded the same files to our CDN + changed urls to point to those. |
| 14336 | Feature | Allow changing locale via api.set | The locale have always been able to be changed via api.set<br/><br/>But now this will trigger the application to also fetch the translations for that locale - meaning the language can now be changed on the fly. | 
| 14210 | Task | 'Waiting for provider' and 'finalizing your transaction' position is off | When reaching finalizing your transaction - both the pending and status icon shows. Should only be one. Bugfix. |
