| #     | Tracker     | Subject   | Description    |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 15750 | Task | Include browser as default attribute in getPaymentMethods | |
| 15680 | Task | Cashier E2E tests - review failing tests | General review of all e2e-tests + execution of those.<br/>Upgraded cypress to 6.X - updated test cases + general stability updated. E2E wasn't stable and often blocked releases due to failing tests seemingly at random/high cpu load |
| 15667 | Task | BUG: fixedProvider={provider} becomes case sensitive when combined with fixedProviderType=true | New feature fixedProvider filters to list of providers to only contain the selected provider (providerType). That fix introduced a bug where providerType became case sensitive when combined with fixedProviderType=true |
| 15666 | Improvement | Sync containerHeight=auto with containerMinHeight | containerMinHeight was prior to this update only applied to the iframe element, not the outer element of the cashier app.<br/>This change passes on the configured height via api.css() and applies the same minHeight to the outer element of the cashier. |
| 15630 | Task | horizontal layout: Payment details doesn't get a provider specific class | Horisontal mode doesn't provide a unique provider class for the content on the right. Added a provider specific class so custom css-rules can be added to target changes specific to providers. |
| 15512 | Task | Transaction history: Don't display ThreeDS2DataCollect type transactions | The transaction history was showing transactions of type 3DS/3DS2. This doesn't really make any sense for the user - so from now on we'll just hide those. |
| 15790 | Bug | Custom cashier amount stays selected when choosing other pre-selected amounts. | Just a bug fix for this - only show custom as marked when there's actually a custom amount set.
